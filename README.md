## About the project

This page was made for the "Battleship" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

The page was meant to showcase the Test Driven Development skills learned so far.

I focused my tests mainly on the computer AI.

You can test the demo [here.](https://jgoldenusr.github.io/8.Battleship/)
